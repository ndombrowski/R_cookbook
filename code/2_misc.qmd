# Miscellaneous

## Search and replace in markdown

If we want to search for the end of the line to, for example, add two spaces (and thus create a linebreak), we can:

- find ```(.)$`` with Regex selected
- and replace with ```\1your_string```


## Print the session info:

This prints our session info (used R version, packages, etc) and is very important to store to reproduce our code for others

```{r,eval=T}
#|eval: false
sessionInfo()
```




### Clean-up the working environment

Notice: At the moment, we do not want to clean up the working directory, therefore, in our documentation we put a ``#`` in front of it. If you want to run the code just remove the ``#``

```{r}
#rm(list = ls()) 
```
